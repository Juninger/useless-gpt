# UselessGPT

Welcome to **UselessGPT!**

*This application was created for the VG-assignment in 'Cross-platform Applications with Web Technologies' (DA395A).*

It works just like the popular ChatGPT, with the *minor* difference that all answers are completely useless and out-of-context. Instead of creating meaningful and relevant responses, UselessGPT delivers pseudo-random messages which can contain quotes from Donald Trump and Kanye West, or facts about numbers.

> :warning: **Warning:** Some responses "generated" by UselessGPT may contain foul language or inappropriate content.
